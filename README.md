## 1. The Project
### Description 
- Aim & purpose of this project
- A rough outline of the class RDSDatabaseConnector
### What I've Learned
1. How to filter columns with missing values
- Median as missing value: when variable is numerical & skewed
- Mean as missing value: when variable is numerical & not skewed
- Mode as missing value: when variable is numerical or categorical?
2. Practically applying the knowledge
- funded_amount: impute the median for missing values due to histogram & qqplot indicating skewness to the right.
- int_rate: impute the median for missing values due to histogram & qqplot indicating skewness to the right.
- employment_length: impute the median/mode due to skewness & the distribution not being close to that of a normal one
- last_payment_date: remove missing value rows due to it not being normally distributed & percentage of missing data being very low (0.1346%)
- last_credit_pull_date: remove missing value rows due to it not being close to a normal distribution & percentage of missing data being extremely low (0.0129%)

##Â 2. Installation Instructions
- import yaml
- import pandas etc if not included in code of the class
- import db_utils.py 

## 3. Usage Instructions
Go through class RDSDatabaseConnector & go through each method.
- load_credentials (loads the credentials.yaml file to give the dictionary for credentials)
- initialise_SQLAlchemy (initialises the SQLAlchemy engine)

## 4. File Structure of the Project
- db_utils.py 
    - This connects to the RDS
    - Converts data to pandas dataframe
    - Converts pandas dataframe to csv
- familiarise_with_data.py
    - Loads loan_payment 
    - Looks at familiarises self with data
- DataTransform_class.py
    - Converts columns to correct data format
    - Contains the class DataTransform, and corresponding methods
- DataFrameInfo.py
    - Extracts information from the DataFrame and it's columns
    - Contains methods to generate useful information about the DataFrame
- missing_values.py
    - Deals with missing data values
    - Creates 2 classes to deal with missing values
    - impute mean when data is numeric & not skewed
    - impute median when data is numeric & skewed
    - impute mode when data i sstring(object) or numeric

## UNFINISHED CODE
- doc strings for RDSDatabaseConnector class in db_utils.py
